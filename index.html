  <h1>Welcome to the Galactic Gazzette</h1>
<h3>Sun thief captured, confesses he sold the Sun to travel the Universe; Mercury and Pluto pick sides </h3>
<p>Planetary police have captured the Sun thief after a gruesomely dark period of 121 weeks in the solar system. The thief turned out to be a 46-year-old Earthling, Darkin Lordin, a real-estate agent from Bolivia who had recently acquired Saturnian citizenship by purchasing a property on one of its rings. Unfortunately, the authorities could not retrieve the stolen Sun from the perpetrator as he confessed that he had sold it to a galactic money lender in order to secure a personal spaceship loan that he was going to use to travel the universe. The concerned money lender was unavailable for a comment. However, lawyers are speculating that the Universal Strict Money Lending Laws will not allow for the Sun to be returned to us at any cost. While climate change activists are celebrating on the streets, sunscreen manufacturers are threatening to go on a cellphone strike. (For those who are not familiar with the latest history of the Earth: lack of adequate daily cellphone consumption can cause fatal damage to a person.) 
Reports from the Solar Planetary Federation (SPF) indicate that at least four out of the remaining eight planets are proposing to press criminal charges in the Galactic Court against Mr. Lordin. Mercurians have, to public surprise, decided to stay out of the issue and instead reward the Sun thief for "Finally getting the painful big ball of billowing fire out of their beautiful black hair". Plutonians, too, have chosen to sit out of the issue, stating that "they never cared for the Sun anyway and the Sun never cared for them anyway, and that the incident was anyway probably a good thing that could eliminate light-privilege from the system and bring a new dawn (pun intended) for all SPF beings, giving them fair and equal opportunities in the galactic society.‚Äù </p>
